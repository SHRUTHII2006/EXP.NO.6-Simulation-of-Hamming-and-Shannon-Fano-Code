# EXP.NO.6-Simulation-of-Hamming-and-Shannon-Fano-Code
6. Simulation of Hamming and Shannon-Fano Code

# AIM

To perform Simulation of Hamming and Shannon-Fano Code using python.


# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

Python Software 

-> Numpy Library 

-> Matplotlib Library 

-> Scipy Library (for signal processing)

# ALGORITHMS

Huffman Coding :

1.Input symbol probabilities

2.Build a binary tree by repeatedly combining two lowest-probability nodes

3.Assign binary codes from the tree (left = 0, right = 1)

4.Calculate:

       Average codeword length

       Entropy

       Efficiency = Entropy / Avg length

       Redundancy = 1 - Efficiency

Shannon-Fano Coding:

1.Input message and count symbol frequencies

2.Sort symbols in decreasing frequency

3.Recursively split into two equal-probability groups

4.Assign 0 to one group, 1 to the other

5.Repeat until each symbol has a unique code

6.Use codes to encode and decode the message
